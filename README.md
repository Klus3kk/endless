## Description

Endless is an experimental OpenGL project that simulates non-Euclidean geometry in a visually striking psychedelic space. The project aims to create disorienting yet beautiful environments where traditional spatial rules don't apply - spaces can be larger on the inside than the outside, hallways can loop back on themselves in impossible ways, and recursive, fractal-like structures can extend infinitely.

## Project Goals

- Create a first-person navigation experience through non-Euclidean spaces
- Generate procedural psychedelic visuals with custom GLSL shaders
- Implement various non-Euclidean geometric principles:
  - Portal systems
  - Space warping
  - Recursive environments
  - Hyperbolic and spherical geometry
